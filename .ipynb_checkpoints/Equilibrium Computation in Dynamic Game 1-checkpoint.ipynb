    "Note that we only consider the computation methods for dynamic game in discrete time model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pakes and McGuire (1994) algorithm, which we call PM94, is the algortihm for exact computing equilibrium in the dynamic oligopoly model, which is developed in Ericson and Pakes (1995), which we call EP95, and many researchers use this in both empirical and theoretical works.\n",
    "\n",
    "But PM94 lacks consideration for multiple equilibria, which is inevitable in most of dynamic game models, and it is  computationally burdensome when the state space of the model has a lot of atates. Furthermore the convergence of this algorithm is not guaranteed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then more sophisticated methos have been developed in order to these problems, and we introduce these in the other courses.\n",

    "In the following, first we descrive the dynamic oliigopoly model of EP95 in order to clarify the problem the alogorithm solve. And then we explain the method with the Julia code."

    "EP95 modeled the dynamic oligopoly, in which there are incumbent firms and potential entrant firms for a market. In the begging of each period the incumbent firms decide whetherto exit or not by comparing the random scrap value with the continuation value of its own, and the potential entrant firms choose if they entry the market by considering the random setup costs and the continuation value. After their decisions the incumbents compete in the static market of differentiated products. And then they carry out investment for the sake of improving the future state. In the last their decisions about entry/exit are implemented before the next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the model we descrive here is a little different from the original one because these offer the condition for equilibrium existence and decrease the computational burden of the algorithms. See Doraszelski and Satterthwaite (2010) and Doraszelski and Pakes (2007) about this point.\n",
