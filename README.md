# Equilibrium_Computation_Julia

I write the article about the equilibrium computation for dynamic game in discrete time. The code is written in Julia. 

The below three algorithms are mentioned in my article.
- [Pakes and McGuire (1994)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2555975?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
- [pakes and McGuire (2001)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0262.00241/abstract)
- [Besanko (2010)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA6994/abstract)

And [Doraszelski and Pakes (2007)](http://scholar.harvard.edu/pakes/publications/framework-applied-dynamic-analysis-io) is a helpful referrence.
